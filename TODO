# TODO (duh)

## Support for New Systems

* UNIX:
  - Solaris (OpenIndiana)
  - MINIX

* BeOS:
  - Haiku

## Support for Current Systems

* I'd like to merge Windows support with *Nix support, in the sense that they should both be in the same
  sub-directory; maybe they shouldn't, but why not.  They'll all live together, but only the ones needed will be pulled into
  the binary when you actually build zbatt.

* Cross compiling for windows should be triggerable from configure and should not require additional helper scripts.
