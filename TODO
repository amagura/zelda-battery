# TODO (duh)

<!-- Last Updated: 2017-11-09 -->

## Support for New Systems

* I'd like to add support for OpenBSD (mostly for the challenge of figuring it out.)

* OpenBSD has sysctl hw.sensors.acpi*

## Support for CSS (Currently Supported Systems)

* I'd like to merge Windows support with *Nix support, in the sense that they should both be in the same
  sub-directory; maybe they shouldn't, but why not.  They'll all live together, but only the ones needed will be pulled into
  the binary when you actually build zbatt.

* Cross compiling for windows should be triggerable from configure and should not require additional helper scripts.
