# TODO (duh)

<!-- Last Updated: 2017-11-22 -->

## Build System

* ZBatt should fail when being compiled on an unsupported system; however, it currently doesn't.

## Run Time

* ZBatt should not fail silently when it encounters a fatal error: or it should at least be an option: fail silently if passed option `-q'.  

## Support for New Systems

* UNIX:
  - Solaris (OpenIndiana)
  - MINIX (probably not worth the effort)
  - OpenBSD (hell, why not: it's a piece of shit, but might as well)

* BeOS:
  - Haiku (will probably require more C++ coding)

## Support for Current Systems

* I'd like to merge Windows support with *Nix support, in the sense that they should both be in the same
  sub-directory; maybe they shouldn't, but why not.  They'll all live together, but only the ones needed will be pulled into
  the binary when you actually build zbatt.

* Cross compiling for windows should be triggerable from configure and should not require additional helper scripts.
